# Independent Learning
  Today I will identify my strength's and weaknesses and spend my time training myself on areas I have deemed myself weak at.

### Strengths
  * Creativity
  * debugging
  * teamwork
  * networking
  * learning

### weaknesses
  * writing complex logic
  * technical terminology and vocab
  * understanding of core computer science principals.


## Plan
  1. Start a free trial at HackerRank and do as many challenges as I can.
  2. Find a resource for technical developer vocabulary and compile a list of important terms to study and create flashcards.

## HackerRank log
This is the log of work done in HackerRank

  1. Started a new account
  2. Choose 'algorithm' course
  3. Solved the "Solve Me First" challenge. This was just a simple a + b exercise.
  4. Solved the "Simple Array Sum" challenge. This actually took me a bit of time because I needed to refamiliarize myself with Java. But the logic was just a for loop that added to a sum after every iteration.
  5. Solved the "compare the triplets" challenge. I had to get some help for this one because I wasn't coming up with the correct answer by myself. I discovered a cool way to compare integers using the conditional "?" operator. The logic I ended up using turned out to be really simple. Instead of using a lot of if else statements, I used "PersonA = (a0>?1:0)" so that if it was true that A was greater than B at a certain position, 1 point would be added to personA's score. If the condition was false, 0 points were added to PersonA's score.
  6. Solved the "A Very Big Sum Challenge". This one was really easy, it was basically the same as "Simple Array Sum" challenge, but required using long instead of int due to the large size of the numbers getting added.
  7. Solved the "Diagonal Difference" challenge. This one actually took me a couple hours to solve. The primary diagonal of a maxtrix was easy to find because after drawing it out, it's just wherever the row number is equal to the column number. The secondary diagonal was really tricky for me to find out how to describe where the diagonal would be at any given row in a matrix.
  I had to go through a lot of different tutorials until I finally found a video that explained it to me in a way that made sense. for each row, the corresponding column would be the number of rows in the matrix, subtracted by 1 (since the array starts at 0), subtracted by the column index.

  8. Solved the "Plus Minus" Challenge. This one was easy but I had weird syntax errors that kept me from passing. I had to find what percentage of positve numbers, negative numbers and 0s an array contained. I figured the logic out very quickly, but I kept having problem printing out multiple variables using the System.Out.println command. I had to use 3 seperate println commands to pass this one.
