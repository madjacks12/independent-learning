# Independent Learning
  Today I will identify my strength's and weaknesses and spend my time training myself on areas I have deemed myself weak at.

### Strengths
  * Creativity
  * debugging
  * teamwork
  * networking
  * learning

### weaknesses
  * writing complex logic
  * technical terminology and vocab
  * understanding of core computer science principals.


## Plan
  1. Start a free trial at HackerRank and do as many challenges as I can.
  2. Find a resource for technical developer vocabulary and compile a list of important terms to study and create flashcards.
